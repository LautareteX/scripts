## About The Project

This is a custom implementation of the printf function in C, developed as a project for Holberton School. The function supports the following format specifiers: %s, %d, %i, %c and %%, and works the same way as the original printf function.

## Usage

The _printf function works very similar as the original printf function.

*Add the HEADER FILE!
*Use the syntax but with '_'.

➡️_printf("format string", arguments);
